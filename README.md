# Final Project Backend
For our final project we divided the frontend and backend into two different repositories. 

In the backend we created three different schemas
 User schema - for the user to be able to login or register to the site
 PersonalNotes Schema - so the user can write down travel memories and save them
 PackingList Schema - so the user can write his/her own packinglist. 


## Tech stack
We used the following technologies
  Node.js
  Express
  MongoDB
  Mongoose
