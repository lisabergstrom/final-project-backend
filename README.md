# Final Project Backend
For our final project we divided the frontend and backend into two different repositories. 
For the backend we created three different schemas
 
   User schema - for the user to be able to login or register to the site\
   PersonalNotes Schema - so the user can write down travel memories and save them\
   PackingList Schema - so the user can write his/her own packinglist


## Tech stack
We used the following technologies

  Node.js\
  Express\
  MongoDB\
  Mongoose
